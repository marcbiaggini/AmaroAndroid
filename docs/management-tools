# Management tools

## Bitbucket

We use Bitbucket for all projects repository.

There is a special one, rockspoon-docs, where the API documentation is being maintained. You can find [all API docs here](https://bitbucket.org/rockspoon/rockspoon-docs/src/c4abb6defe7f/Books/Backend/api/?at=master).

## ASANA

We use [ASANA](https://app.asana.com/) to manage tasks. Detailed information about task management can be found on [Project Management with Scrum](project-management-with-scrum.md) document.

On the Scrum board, we use the following workflow:

For tasks that don't need a Pull Request, you can transition straight to "Done".
For tasks that that need Pulll Requests, always transition to "In Review". Reviewer will change to "Done" or "Reopened".

## Drive

All assets needed to create graphical elements will be in [this Drive shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive).

When you start developing a new feature, ask the team leader for the inner assets present on the screen.

## Slack

We mantain the #customer-app Slack channel for team comunication.
